# Negotiation Chatbot Demo

This demo script showcases a typical interaction with our Gemini-powered negotiation chatbot. The initial price is set at \$100, with a negotiation range of \$80 to \$120.

```
Bot: Welcome to our negotiation chatbot! We're discussing the price of our premium widget. The current price is $100. How can I assist you today?

User: Hi, I'm interested in buying your widget, but $100 seems a bit high. Can you offer a better price?

Bot: I understand your concern about the price. Our premium widget is of high quality and offers great value. However, I appreciate your interest, so I could offer a small discount. How about $95? This is a 5% reduction from our initial price.

User: That's a start, but I was hoping for something closer to $85. Is that possible?

Bot: I appreciate your counter-offer, but $85 is below our cost for this premium product. However, I want to find a middle ground. I can offer you the widget for $90, which is a significant 10% discount from our original price. This is really the best I can do while ensuring we maintain our quality standards. Would that work for you?

User: $90 is better, but my budget is tight. Could we meet in the middle at $87.50?

Bot: I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. After careful consideration, I can accept your offer of $87.50. This is a 12.5% discount from our original price, which is quite significant. It's the absolute lowest we can go while still ensuring you receive our high-quality product. Shall we proceed with this price?

User: That sounds great! I'll take it at $87.50.

Bot: Excellent! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. To confirm, we've settled on a price of $87.50 for our premium widget, which represents a 12.5% discount from the original price. Thank you for your business! Is there anything else you'd like to know about the product or the purchase process?

User: No, that's all. Thanks for working with me on the price.

Bot: You're welcome! I'm happy we could find a price that works for both of us. Thank you for choosing our product, and we look forward to serving you. If you have any questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. Have a great day!

## Key Points of the Negotiation:

1. **Opening**: The bot starts by stating the current price (\$100) and invites the user to engage.

2. **First Offer**: When the user expresses that the price is high, the bot offers a small discount to \$95 (5% off).

3. **Counter-Offer**: The user proposes \$85, which the bot declines as too low, but counters with \$90 (10% off).

4. **Final Negotiation**: The user suggests meeting in the middle at \$87.50. The bot accepts this offer after consideration.

5. **Closing**: The bot confirms the final price, expresses appreciation for the business, and offers further assistance.

Throughout the negotiation, the bot:
- Remains polite and professional
- Explains the reasoning behind its offers
- Shows flexibility within the predetermined price range (\$80 to \$120)
- Uses percentages to highlight the value of the discounts
- Maintains a balance between making sales and preserving product value

This demo illustrates how the Gemini model, with appropriate prompting, can conduct a nuanced, context-aware negotiation that feels natural and responsive to the user's inputs.
